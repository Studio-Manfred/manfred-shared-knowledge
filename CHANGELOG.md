## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.1] — 2026-04-19

### Fixed
- `uninstall.sh` piped via `curl | bash` now errors clearly with a `--yes` hint instead of silently aborting on consumed stdin
- README uninstall command updated to pass `-s -- --yes` so `curl | bash` works end-to-end

### Added
- `*.backup.*` to `.gitignore` (installer backup files)
- Contributing guide entry for `shared/roles/` playbooks

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-19

- Placeholder home-level `CLAUDE.md` installed via `shared/home-claude.md`
- Placeholder `shared/manfred-brand.md`
- Project-level `CLAUDE.md` template at repo root
- Empty `skills/`, `commands/`, `plugins/`, `shared/roles/` directories ready for content
